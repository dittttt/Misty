I need to make a game through java. 
The game will be called "Misty"


The game will be like sekiro, except it's a pixel art sidescrolling game with twists.


Graphics Design idea:
- Simple Pixel art style
- Nice looking backgrounds
- Dashing turns you to a misty shadow thing, dashing forward to the direction you chose
- Dodge like brawlhalla


Character idea:
- Jingasa
- Red or Blue Cloak
- Katana
- Shadowy Figure


Main Movement Mechanics:
- Left / Right Movement (A or D)
- Walk (default)
- Run (Shift)
- Jump (Space or W)
- Dash (Double tap Shift)


Main Combat Mechanics:
- Lock Opponent (L)
- Back Dash (S or back direction + Shift)
- Block (Hold Rmb or K)
- Parry (Tap Rmb or K)
- Dash Attack (Double tap Shift + Light or Heavy)
- Light Attack (Lmb or J)
- Heavy Attack (Hold Lmb or J)


How do I make this in java?


First I need the actual screen to be there. Here are the specifications:
- 1920 x 1080
- 60fps
- 16x16 tiles. This needs to be scaled up so that this could also match with other resolutions.


Next I need to make the movements and the sprite to appear.
I only want the directions to be this:
- Left
- Right
- Jump


Make me the base for the game in java.
